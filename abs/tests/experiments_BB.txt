For each method/function I put: 
    - The set of considered inputs (as term-sizes). 
    - the real consumptions (number of cons's)
    - The evaluation of the UB for each input. 
    - To evaluate an UB:
        ?- use_module(stdlib(utils)). 
	?- B = 10,ut_arithmetic_eval(9*nat(B),Z).



* main: <10,9>/<20,9>  61/121  121/241
- I consider the number of iterations as an input. 
- The buffer cannot have more than 4 elems when it appends, so the
bound on field(bf) is 9)



* The functions seem to provide exact UBs
