For each method/function I put: 
    - The set of considered inputs (as term-sizes). 
    - the real consumptions (number of cons's)
    - The evaluation of the UB for each input. 
    - To evaluate an UB:
        ?- use_module(stdlib(utils)). 
	?- B = 10,ut_arithmetic_eval(9*nat(B),Z).


E.g.

* m <5,5>/<10,10>  25/50  30/60

This means that for the input <5,5> (there are two inputs) the real
consumption is 25 and the UB says 30, and for the input <10,10> the
real consumption is 50 and the UB says 60. An '_' on an input
indicates that it does not affect the cost.


main:
-----

* 9  16  67
(The input is the bound on the map field of Node. In the example there
are at most 2 pairs in a node so the term size is 9)



Functions:
----------

* put  <21,_,_>/<21,_,_>/<41,_,_>  8/4/13  13/13/23
