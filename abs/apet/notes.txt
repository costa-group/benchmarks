-----------

- 6 vs. 2 results (with indep(r1,r0) and indep(r2,r0))


DistHT
------

- 36 vs. 6 results with 3 get/put calls on the same node

- 576 vs. 24 results with 4 get/put calls on the same node

- We get square root reduction

- Even better using getAllData. E.g., with 2 putData and a getAllData
  of the two, both in the same node, we get 480 vs. 12 !

MailServer:
-----------

- From aPET: 288 vs. 100 with two users and two notify calls

- From Prolog: 2648 (1.3s) vs. 460 (0.26s) with two users and two notify calls

- From aPET: 1824 (in almost 2 mins!) vs. 128 (in just 5 secs!) with
  two users and three notify calls

- From Prolog: 27880 (3.9s) vs. no results in more than 10 minutes!

- Results would be even better if we delete the user field from
  MailServer and just provide an enumerator to enumerate users from
  the AddressBook
